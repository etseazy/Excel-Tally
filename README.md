### Excel File Format
Your Excel file MUST have exactly these 4 columns with exact names:

|--------------|-----------------------|------------------|
| **Date**     | Transaction date      | 10-04-2025       |
| **Amount**   | Transaction amount    | 100 (+ve) or -50 (-ve) |
| **Narration**| Description           | "Fees received"  |
| **GL**       | General Ledger account| "Suspense"       |

**Important Notes:**
- Column names are case-sensitive.
- Positive amounts = Cash receipts (Cash Dr, GL Cr).
- Negative amounts = Cash payments (GL Dr, Cash Cr).

### As a Standalone Executable

1. Double-click the executable, or run from command line:
   ```bash
   Excel2Tally.exe
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Select your Excel file**  
   The app checks for required columns and loads your transactions.

2. **Preview your data**  
   See a summary of the transactions to be sent to Tally.

3. **Transfer to Tally**  
   The tool generates XML and sends it to Tally.  
   Youâ€™ll get a success or error message, and a preview XML is saved as `tally_preview.xml`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Tally not responding?**
  - Make sure Tally is running and the Gateway Server is enabled (port 9000).
  - The company you want to import into must be open in Tally.
  - All ledger names in your Excel must exist in Tally.

- **Ledger does not exist error?**
  - Check that all `GL` values in your Excel match ledger names in Tally exactly.

- **Other issues?**
  - See `Troubleshooting steps.txt` for more help.

## Customization

- To change the default company, edit the `<SVCURRENTCOMPANY>` value in `xml_generator.py`.
- To change the icon for the executable, use the `--icon=youricon.ico` option with PyInstaller.
